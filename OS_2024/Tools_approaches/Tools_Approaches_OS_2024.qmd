## The Data Management Plan (DMP)

***A document that describe your research data and how you plan to handle them***

-   How is your data collected

-   How is your data stored

-   Who owns the data

-   How is the data going to be shared and archived

-   Are there any legal or ethical (e.g. GDPR) issues?

-   Volume of data

-   Costs associated with storing /archiving – and who is paying

## The Data Management Plan (DMP)

A DMP usually start out with a template:

## Preregistration of your hypothesis

***A document that describe your research hypotheses and how you plan to test them***

-   A clear description of your hypothesis / hypotheses

-   A clear description of how you plan to collect data to test them

-   A clear description of how you plan to test them statistically

-   A clear description of how you plan to report the results

## Registered reports: taking it one step further

## Registered reports: taking it one step further

*A per-reviewed document (report) that clearly outline the hypotheses, data collection, data analyses and reporting prior to conducting the research*

-   Extends the pre-registration discussed so far because the report is also per-reviewed

-   After revision (or repeated revisions) the report is de-facto accepted for publication by the journal

-   Offered by several journals \[e.g. [Ecological Solutions and Evidence: Registered Reports Author Guidelines (wiley.com)](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/26888319/registered-reports-author-guidelines)

## Data papers

***A data paper is a textual (extended) description of your data***

-   It is a per-reviewed publication describing a data set, published in a journal

-   The main purpose of the data paper is to document data, not to solve new research questions

-   A data paper can increase visibility and ensure you get credit for the data you share

-   The paper link to the data, but you still need to find a suitable place to share (publish) your data

-   Example: [Data papers (gbif.org)](https://www.gbif.org/data-papers)
